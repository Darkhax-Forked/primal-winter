_A horrible accident has left the world - the **entire** world - a frozen wasteland. Unending snowstorms rage across the land, from forests, to plains, to jungles, to deserts. The air is thick with fog and wind howls across the landscape. Will you be able to survive in this primordial winter?_

### Features

This mod will turn your entire world into a frozen wasteland. It adds several new blocks, and has many client side aesthetic tweaks to immerse yourself in the winter wonderland you now inhabit.

- A thick white fog obscures your view when you are outside.
- The weather is always snowy and thundering, and there's more snow including extra particle effects and sounds.
- Most surface blocks are replaced with snowy variants. These can be mined to obtain their vanilla counterparts.
- Polar bears and strays now spawn everywhere.
- Ice spikes, icebergs, and packed ice pools appear sporadically in all biomes, snow and ice placement has been improved and now layers more intuitively and can creep into caves and under overhangs such as trees during world generation.
